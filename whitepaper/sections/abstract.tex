As software engineering transitions from human-centric to agent-centric workflows, the limitations of traditional file-system abstractions and naive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems become apparent. Agents require more than just text retrieval; they need a "Codebase Operating System" that provides high-fidelity, constant-memory semantic understanding of massive repositories.

This paper introduces \textbf{SAGUARO}, a Quantum Codebase Operating System (Q-COS). SAGUARO leverages C++ based holographic embeddings, leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) principles to map code into an 8192-dimensional vector space. By implementing "Quantum Ops" such as \texttt{QuantumEmbeddingForward} and \texttt{SAGUAROHolographicBundle}, SAGUARO allows agents to query, verify, and understand the semantic state of a repository with $O(1)$ complexity relative to context window size. We demonstrate how SAGUARO enables a safe, autonomous "Native Agent Protocol" characterized by self-verification and legislative drift detection.
