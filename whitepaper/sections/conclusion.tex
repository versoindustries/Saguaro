SAGUARO represents the next evolutionary step for software repositories. By treating the codebase as a high-dimensional quantum object and providing a strict protocol for agent interaction, it enables the safe scaling of autonomous engineering.

As we move towards teams of agents collaborating on complex systems, the need for a Q-COS like SAGUARO becomes undeniable. It provides the shared reality, the memory, and the laws required for digital intelligence to build digital infrastructure reliably.
